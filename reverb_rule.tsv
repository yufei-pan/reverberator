If true, can take long to initialize / fail to initialize if backup space is small 	If true, file attr change will get synced to the most recent file backup 	set to 0 for infinity	Maybe inaccurate on CoW File systems. Use 0 for infinity, % numbers refer to disk usage %, use leading i to represent inodes	Will auto record if not set, use string literal N/A if does not care about FS
